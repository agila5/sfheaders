# sfheaders


## Another spatial library?

Yep. In a few of my other libraries I've made use of `sf` objects, but without importing the `sf` library itself. This is by design because `sf` is quite a 'heavy' library. 

Therefore I've written / copied these methods for constructing the `sf` objects across a few different libraries. 

So I thought it would be useful to have these in one place. And here they are (or will be, when it's finished).



## Can I use these methods too?

Yep

TODO: how to use.
